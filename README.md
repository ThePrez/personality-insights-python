# 3-minute Watsoning Demo for IBM i
  This application is a fork of an existing project on Watson Developer Cloud. It has been showcased as part of a "3 minute demo" to demonstrate how quickly one can deploy a cognitive application to IBM i.
  
  The IBM Watson [Personality Insights][service_url] service uses linguistic analysis to extract cognitive and social characteristics from input text such as email, text messages, tweets, forum posts, and more. By deriving cognitive and social preferences, the service helps users to understand, connect to, and communicate with other people on a more personalized level.
  
# Deploying this application to IBM i

1. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your IBM i by running the "python3 --version" command. 
  
    
2. Create an IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix) Account

    [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.
  
3. Get credentials for the Personality Insights API

4. Change directory (cd) to the directory you'd like to work in, for instance:
    ```git clone https://github.com/ThePrez/3-minute-watsoning/```
4. Clone this repository to IBM i, by running this command in an ssh session (after creating and cd'ing to your directory). This will clone the project into a subdirectory named "3-minute-watsoning". Keep your SSH session open. 

    ```git clone https://github.com/ThePrez/3-minute-watsoning/```
    
5. Edit the file "server.py" in the following ways:
     - Edit the file’s “Local variables” section (around line 35) with the following values (substituting your credential information from step 3): 
          ```
               self.url = "<your_URL_from_step3>"
               self.username = "<your_username_from_step3>"
               self.password = "<your_password_from_step3>"

     - Change the PORT_NUMBER variable (around line 112) to be "50011" or another free port on your system.  

6. After the file is saved, return to your SSH session, cd to the newly-created "3-minute-watsoning" directory, and run the following command to install the necessary Python packages:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    
7. From the SSH session, run the following command to start the web server: 

    ```
    python3 ./server.py

8. Open a browser, pointed at the URL http://<your_system_name>:50011 (or whatever port you chose in step 4)

## Deploying this application to IBM Cloud (formerly Bluemix)

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
  applications:
  - name: personality-insights-python
    command: python server.py
    path: .
    memory: 256M
    services:
    - personality-insights-service
  ```

    The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

5. Create the Personality Insights service in Bluemix

  ```sh
  $ cf create-service personality_insights tiered personality-insights-service
  ```

6. Push it live!

  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

  See the full [Getting Started][getting_started] documentation for more details, including code snippets and references.

## Running locally
  The application uses [Python](https://www.python.org) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) so you will have to download and install them as part of the steps below.

1. Copy the credentials from your `personality-insights-service` service in Bluemix to `server.py`, you can see the credentials using:

  ```sh
  $ cf env <application-name>
  ```
  Example output:
  ```sh
  System-Provided:
  {
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "personality_insights": [{
        "credentials": {
          "url": "<url>",
          "password": "<password>",
          "username": "<username>"
        },
      "label": "personality_insights",
      "name": "personality-insights-service",
      "plan": "IBM Watson Personality Insights Monthly Plan"
   }]
  }
  }
  ```

    You need to copy `username`, `password` and `url`.

2. Install [Python 2.7.9 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the application
  `python server.py`
5. Go to
  `http://localhost:3000`


## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix app the main useful source of information are the logs, to see them, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```
